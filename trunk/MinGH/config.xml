    <!-- The different speed mod settings.  You can edit or add however many settings 
         you want as long as the selectedSpeedMod points to a speedMod of the same id,
         else a default (probably wrong) value will be used.  Also ensure no two speedMods
         share the same id, else untold things will happen.
         -MSOffset: The number of milisecondsseconds a note should be displayed early
                    (i.e. higher speeds need a lower offset).  Edit this if notes
                    appear to come too early or late.  A higher number = earlier notes.
         -NVMultiplier: The note velocity multiplier denotes how fast the notes will move down
                        the screen (i.e. higher = faster).  Edit this if notes scroll too fast
                        or slow. -->
